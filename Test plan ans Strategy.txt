//Part I – Test Plan & Strategy
1. User Registration

Main Goal:
Ensure the user registration API works correctly, validates all fields, and rejects invalid data. Confirm that duplicate users cannot be created.

Scope:
Fields to test: first_name, middle_name, last_name, phone_number, email, username, password, confirm_password. Test each individually and in combination.

Test Strategy:

Positive tests: Provide valid data to confirm successful registration.

Negative tests: Provide invalid/missing data to verify validation messages and error codes.

Positive Cases:

All fields correct → user created.

Unique email and username → success.

Password ≥ 8 characters and matches confirm → success.

Correct phone format → success.

Negative Cases:

Missing required field → fail.

Invalid email format → fail.

Password < 8 chars → fail.

Password and confirm mismatch → fail.

Duplicate email/username → fail.

Invalid phone → fail.

Empty payload → multiple validation errors.

Test Data:
Normal names, test@example.com, invalid emails like "abc@", valid and invalid passwords, duplicate emails.

Expected Output:

Valid data → HTTP 200/201, success: true, message "User registered successfully".

Invalid data → HTTP 400/422, field-specific error messages. API should not crash or leak sensitive info.

2. User Login

Main Goal:
Ensure authentication works correctly and invalid credentials are rejected.

Test Strategy:

Manual POST requests using Postman.

Verify status codes, response body, and validation messages.

Test for robustness against invalid or random inputs.

Positive Case:

Valid email + valid password → HTTP 200, success message, token returned.

Negative Cases:

Wrong password → fail.

Wrong email → fail.

Empty fields → fail.

Bad email format → fail.

Short password → fail.

Expected Output:

Valid credentials → success: true, login success, token returned.

Invalid credentials → proper error message, no token, secure handling.
